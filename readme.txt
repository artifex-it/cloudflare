CloudFlare integrates your blog with the CloudFlare platform.

== Description ==

The CloudFlare plugin integrates your blog with the CloudFlare platform.

The CloudFlare platform protects and accelerates any website online. Once your website is a part of the CloudFlare community, its web traffic is routed through our intelligent global network. We automatically optimize the delivery of your web pages so your visitors get the fastest page load times and best performance. We also block threats and limit abusive bots and crawlers from wasting your bandwidth and server resources. The result: CloudFlare-powered websites see a significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks.
